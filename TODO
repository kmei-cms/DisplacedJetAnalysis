Things to figure out:

1. How to properly use the edm::View object. Ask the CMSDAS people how to parse the edm information?

2. Develop the python code for the displaced jet tag - using b tag as a base?

3. Make plots of the three major variables (figure out how to uniquely do the track vertex association?)
